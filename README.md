# slml2018
The repository includes codes and part of results for slml final project, 'One Shot Learning', 2018-19, Fudan University.


## 'models'
In directory 'models', there are codes for models used in my paper, including:
Image features extractors: ResNet50, DenseNet121, AlexNet and VGG16;
One-shot learning models: ESOSL, SiameseNN, MatchingNetwork and Cosine-basedNN;
Linear classification models: SVR, KNN and Logistic Regression.


## 'mini_imagenet'
This is the data set 'mini-imagenet' offered by Prof. Fu.


## 'results'
These are part of trained models.


## 'utils'
These utils are used in most models, including funtions to get data, compute cross entropy loss and so on.


## Appreciation
Most of these models are completed by myself, including ResNet, DenseNet, AlexNet, VGG, linear models and ESOSL.

And part of these codes are developed based on open source codes offered on github. Thanks to gidariss for Cosine-basedNN (https://github.com/gidariss/FewShotWithoutForgetting), yijiuzai for Matching Network (https://github.com/yijiuzai/Matching-Networks-for-One-Shot-Learning) and Lectures2codes for SiameseNN and some utils(https://github.com/Lectures2Code/slml/tree/master/models).
