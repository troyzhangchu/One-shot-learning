This repository includes codes for my course Statistical Learning and Machine Learning in Fudan University.These codes are used for my final project, which is about one shot learning.


## 'models'
In the directory 'models', there are codes for several models used in my paper, including:

Image features extractors: ResNet50, DenseNet121, AlexNet and VGG16;
One-shot learning models: ESOSL, SiameseNN;
Linear classification models: SVR, kNN and Logistic Regression.


## 'utils'
These utils are used in most models, including funtions to get data, compute cross entropy loss and so on.


## Appreciation
Most of these models are completed by myself, including ResNet, DenseNet, AlexNet, VGG, linear models and ESOSL.

And part of these codes are developed based on open source codes offered on github. Thanks to gidariss for Cosine-basedNN (https://github.com/gidariss/FewShotWithoutForgetting), yijiuzai for Matching Network (https://github.com/yijiuzai/Matching-Networks-for-One-Shot-Learning) and Lectures2codes for SiameseNN and some utils(https://github.com/Lectures2Code/slml/tree/master/models).
